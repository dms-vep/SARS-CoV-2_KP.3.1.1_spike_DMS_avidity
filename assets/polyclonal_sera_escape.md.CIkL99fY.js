The line plots summarize the effects of mutations at each measured site, while the heatmaps below show the effects of individual mutations. Each panel groups all pre- or post- infection/vaccination sera. Note that the two different shades of gray in the heatmaps have differing meanings: light gray means a mutation was missing (not measured) in the library, whereas dark gray means a mutation was measured but was so deleterious for cell entry it is not possible to reliably estimate its effect on other phenotypes (the threshold for how deleterious a mutation must be for cell entry to be shown in dark gray is controlled by the cell entry slider at the bottom of the plot). By default the plot only shows positive escape (mutations that reduce neutralization), but if you set the <em>floor escape at zero</em> option at the bottom of the plot then you can also see mutations that increase serum neutralization (negative escape).</p>',6)),t(i,{caption:"Effects of mutations to spike on pre and post infection/vaccination sera neutralization for each exposure group"},{default:l(()=>[t(s,{showShadow:!0,"spec-url":"htmls/sera_group_averages_overlaid.html"})]),_:1}),e[1]||(e[1]=a("h2",{id:"per-individual-comparison-of-effects-of-mutations-neutralization-by-pre-and-post-infection-vaccination-serum",tabindex:"-1"},[o("Per-individual comparison of effects of mutations neutralization by pre- and post-infection/vaccination serum "),a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#per-individual-comparison-of-effects-of-mutations-neutralization-by-pre-and-post-infection-vaccination-serum","aria-label":'Permalink to "Per-individual comparison of effects of mutations neutralization by pre- and post-infection/vaccination serum"'},"​")],-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=a("p",null,[o("The plots below show the effects of mutations on neutralization by sera from the same individual collected either pre- or post-infection/vaccination.
