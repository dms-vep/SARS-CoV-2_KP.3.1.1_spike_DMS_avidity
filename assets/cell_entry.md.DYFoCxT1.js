Effects greater than zero (blue) indicate a mutation improves cell entry while effects less than zero (orange) indicate a mutation impairs cell entry. X indicates the wild-type amino acid in KP.3.1.1. Light grey indicates mutations for which effects were not measured in our libraries; note that our library design excluded most mutations expected to be highly deleterious from all regions of the spike except for the RBD. You can also mouseover points for details on the measurements in each library replicate, and use the options at the bottom of the plot to adjust various filtering and display options.</p><p>Click <a href="htmls/293T_medium_ACE2_entry_func_effects.html" target="_self">here</a> for a standalone link to the heatmap shown below.</p>',6)),n(l,{caption:"Effects of mutations on entry in 293T cells expressing ACE2"},{default:m(()=>[n(s,{showShadow:!0,"spec-url":"htmls/293T_medium_ACE2_entry_func_effects.html"})]),_:1}),e[1]||(e[1]=t("h2",{id:"numerical-values-for-cell-entry-measurements",tabindex:"-1"},[a("Numerical values for cell entry measurements "),t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#numerical-values-for-cell-entry-measurements","aria-label":'Permalink to "Numerical values for cell entry measurements"'},"​")],-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=t("p",null,[a("For the measured effects of mutations on entry after filtering and averaging across replicates, see the "),t("em",null,"spike mediated entry"),a(" column of "),t("a",{href:"https://github.com/dms-vep/SARS-CoV-2_KP.3.1.1_spike_DMS/blob/main/results/summaries/antibody_escape.csv",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},"this CSV"),a(".
